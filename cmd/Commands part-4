ðŸ”¹ 5. Developer-Specific Commands

Many developers use CMD to compile, run, or manage projects.

Command       	                                        Use
where <program>	                                        Find location of an installed program (e.g., where python).
assoc .ext	                                            Shows which program opens a file type (useful for fixing wrong associations).
attrib +r -h <file>	                                    Change file attributes (readonly, hidden, etc.).
path	                                                  Shows system PATH variable (important for compilers like Java, Python, Node.js).
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\bin"	                      Add something to PATH permanently.
fc file1 file2	                                        Compare two files line by line.
find "text" file.txt	                                  Search for text inside a file.
choco install <package>	(if Chocolatey is installed)    Install software from CMD.


ðŸ”¹ 6. Advanced Tricks

&& â†’ Run multiple commands in sequence (e.g., cd project && dir).

> â†’ Redirect output to a file (e.g., dir > files.txt).

>> â†’ Append output to a file.

| â†’ Pipe output into another command (e.g., dir | find "test").


ðŸ”¹ For coders, the most important are:

* cd, dir, mkdir, del, move, copy, notepad (daily navigation).

* path, where, setx (compiler setup).

* ping, ipconfig, nslookup, netstat (network debugging).

* tasklist, taskkill (process handling).
